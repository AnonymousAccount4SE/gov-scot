additions:
replace old data-gtm attributes where necessary
communicate any necessary publication changes to APS and/or make sure we can support what APS give us
publication download block (thumbnail, file size, download button, etc)
search results with sub-links in them ("this is part of a collection" etc)
generic file icons (for when there is no thumbnail or the file is not a pdf)
regenerate images with new sizing and better compression (in CMS)
other DS components that are not listed (back to top, cookie banner, cookie page, side navigation, skip links)

things that are built but not on the epic (there are probably a bunch more than I'm listing here; some of these should ultimately move to the DS):
search filters
new "feature header" component (FM title, topic titles)
toggle link (e.g. "From: role 1, role 2, +n more")

things that are built but need work:
update history styling
secondary footer (where social icons live)
homepage featured items (I have it done, but KA has an updated version in progress)
cards with metadata
spacing on homepage

subtractions:
MGS-6506 (layout tests) is not specific to gov
MGS-6464 and MGS-6507 (breadcrumbs) are for the same thing
